## About the App
The Web App in this folder is titled "Signs in the Southeast: A Web App for Climate Change Response Assessment in ASEAN." It is a visualization app made through Dash, visualizing several climate change and sustainability indices of countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

The application was coded through Visual Studio Code. This visualization app is part of the course requirement for Data Visualization in the Data Science Minor of De La Salle University - Manila.

## Usage
### Requirements
To run the app, you need the following:
1. A working internet connection, as the datasets used in this app are all sourced from the GitHub of one of the creators. This was done to make running the app possible with only the .py file. The GitHub link is found at https://github.com/hxwwong/data101-final-project
2. An application that can run .py files. You may use Visual Studio Code or other equivalents.
3. In your coding environment for Python, you must have the following installed:
* dash Version 2.3.1
* dash-bootstrap-components Version 0.8.3
* matplotlib Version 3.4.3
* plotly Version 5.7.0 
* pandas Version 1.3.4 

*Note that later versions of the above may be used. It also must be noted that later versions of these libraries can have updated or truncated codes, resulting in the inability of the app to run in versions other than what is specified above.*

### How to Run
1. The app's code does not need to be altered in any way to be run. Simply run the app in your application of choice.
2. The app will open in your web browser and/or be indicated in your application of choice that it is running in a certain link. This link was http://127.0.0.1:8050/ for the app's creators.

In the event that the application is not running for you, simply inform one of the creators at arianne_pastrana@dlsu.edu.ph. 

## Authors and Acknowledgment
The application was created by DLSU students Fernandez, Lyka; Miranda, Vince; Pastrana, Ari; and Wong, Hans. 

The application's creation would not have been possible without the steadfast support and guidance of their Data Visualization professor, Ms. Unisse C. Chua. 

## Project Status
The web application has been completed last July 5, 2022.
